It’s in these close-knit communities that the loss of a beloved member leaves a profound impact, and it is with heavy hearts that we share the obituary of Joseph “Joey” Patrick Rathbun, who passed away on September 23, 2023, at the age of 30. His memory will forever be cherished by those who knew him.</p><p>Joey Rathbun was a vibrant and beloved member of the Monona community. His warm smile, caring nature, and zest for life left an indelible mark on everyone he encountered. Joey’s untimely passing has left a void that cannot be filled, but his spirit lives on in the memories of those who were fortunate to know him. Born in Monona, Joey was a proud son of Iowa. He grew up in this picturesque town, surrounded by rolling hills and the mighty Mississippi River.</p><p>As a child, he was known for his boundless energy and love for adventure. Whether it was climbing trees, exploring the woods, or riding his bike around town, Joey’s curiosity knew no bounds. As he grew older, Joey’s adventurous spirit took him beyond Monona’s borders. He pursued his education with determination and enthusiasm, always seeking to expand his horizons. His love for learning was matched only by his passion for helping others.</p><p>Joey’s kind heart led him to be actively involved in community service, volunteering his time to various causes and always ready to lend a helping hand. Joey’s magnetic personality drew people to him effortlessly. He had a knack for making friends wherever he went, and his friendships were marked by loyalty and unwavering support. He cherished the people in his life and made it a point to let them know how much they meant to him.</p><p>Music was another one of Joey’s passions. His love for playing the guitar brought joy to those who had the privilege of listening to his soulful tunes. Whether he was strumming a melody on a lazy summer evening or jamming with friends, his music was a reflection of his free spirit and creativity. To celebrate Joey Rathbun’s life and the legacy he leaves behind, a Celebration of Life will be held on Friday, September 29, 2023, from 3:00 pm to 7:00 pm at the Waukon Banquet Center in Waukon, Iowa.</p><p>It will be an opportunity for friends, family, and the community to come together, share stories, and remember the joy Joey brought into their lives. In lieu of flowers, the Rathbun family kindly requests that memorial contributions be made in Joey’s honor. These memorials will help preserve his memory and support the causes he cared deeply about. The Leonard-Grau Funeral Home and Cremation Service of Monona, Iowa, is assisting the family with the arrangements, ensuring that this celebration of Joey’s life is a fitting tribute to a young man who touched so many hearts.</p><p>Joey Rathbun’s departure from this world leaves a void, but his memory will continue to inspire and uplift all those who were fortunate enough to have known him. In the stories we share, the music we play, and the lives we touch, Joey’s spirit will live on, reminding us of the precious gift of life and the importance of spreading love, kindness, and joy in our community. Rest in peace, Joey Rathbun. Monona, Iowa, will forever hold you in its heart.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaKKfmsZuvsCtn5utnmK8o7XTrpirsV2ivK%2B7zZpkoqenlnqru8SyZKuZpJ2vtrqMnZyarJhirq%2BwjJ%2Bsp52ilrlw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./angie-dickinson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Angie Dickinson  Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story">&larr;
