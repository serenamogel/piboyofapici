The time of year when your coworker comes into work on Monday with a sniffle they swear is “random bad allergies in January” and by Wednesday they are home sick with “that awful thing that’s been going around.” But whether it is the flu, COVID, or just a touch of seasonal <a href=# rel=noopener>ennui</a>, you already know one of the best remedies is a big ol’ bowl of soup. So without further ado, here is our list of the best soups to eat when you are sick.&nbsp;We’re not doctors, but we know what tastes good—even when your nose is clogged and your taste buds are on sick leave.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Rao’s Chicken Noodle Soup</strong></a><p>Everyone knows that chicken noodle soup is the soup for sickness. And there’s truly no better chicken noodle soup at the grocery store than Rao’s Chicken Noodle Soup, which you’ll find in a jar in the soup aisle. “The noodles taste homemade––eggy, substantial and delightfully chewy. And the herbaceousness is on par with what you’d expect from a homemade soup,” our taste tester raved. If you’re doomsday prepping for flu season, don’t forget this one, folks. —Naajia Shukri</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=#>best chicken noodle soup</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Amy’s Organic Southwestern Fire Roasted Vegetable Soup</strong></a><p>If you’re vegetarian or vegan and chicken noodle soup is off the menu, Amy’s has the perfect soup for when you are sick. A lot of vegetable soups can be sort of watery and dull, but if need something that’s going to make an impression, even when your sinuses are 85% clogged, rest assured that Amy’s Fire Roasted veggie soup is wonderfully seasoned, versatile, and “bursting with flavor.” Sporked‘s <a href=#>Jordan Myrick</a> recommends pairing this soup with some <a href=#>shredded cheddar</a>, diced raw onion, and a bit of fresh lime to really enhance its flavors. Veggie lovers, don’t sleep on this one, even if you’re on bed rest.&nbsp;—Naajia Shukri</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=#>best vegetable soup</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Andersen’s Creamy Split Pea Soup</strong></a></strong><p>I know the classic “when you are sick, eat this soup” soup is usually some form of <a href=#>broth</a>, but when you’re in those final stages of a seasonal illness, sometimes you want something that’s thick and hearty and will fill you up a bit more. That’s why we think this pea soup is one of the best soups for sickness. It will give you a bit of protein, fiber, and flavor, and, as an added bonus, it looks a little bit like it belongs in the greatest movie of all time: Shrek*. Plus, if you’re a Californian and need your Pea Soup Andersen’s fix now that their <a href=# rel=noopener>famed Buellton outpost has closed</a>, it’s excellent news that this stuff comes in a can. Sporked managing editor and ardent pea soup lover <a href=#>Gwynedd Stuart</a> called it the “best canned split pea soup I’ve ever tasted, I need you to believe me. It’s unbelievably creamy.” That is high praise from a professional food taste tester, so I say that makes this one of the best soups for when you are sick.</p><p>*side note: Highly recommend you watch Shrek the next time you are sick. That movie is like pea soup for the soul. —Jessica Block</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=#>best split pea soup</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Progresso Traditional Soup Beef & Vegetable</strong></a><p>This vegetable beef soup is another hearty option when you’re on the mend and desperately need the energy to get out of bed and take a shower for the first time in three days. In it you’ll find carrots, potatoes, green beans, tomatoes, and onions, which “all work together to provide a robust flavor,” according to our taste tester. The best soup for sickness covers a lot of bases: it has some meat for protein, some veggies for vitamins, and a savory broth to soothe your throat. Progresso Beef & Vegetable soup has all that and more. Good on you, Progresso, for looking out for the (sick) little guy.&nbsp;—Naajia Shukri</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=#>best vegetable beef soup</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Pacific Foods Organic Creamy Tomato Soup</strong></a><p>When you’ve been hacking up a lung all week (this is your reminder to get a flu shot, btw), there’s nothing quite as soothing as thick, creamy tomato soup sliding down your throat. And Pacific Foods makes what’s just about the creamiest tomato soup you can get your germy little hands on. According to Sporked editor-in-chief Justine Sterling, “This soup is as decadent as plain tomato soup can get.” She also described it as “comfort to the max,” which is what you really need in the best soups for sickness. Sick people, rejoice (but not too hard)—Pacific Foods is here to comfort you .—Naajia Shukri</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=#>best tomato soup</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong></strong></a><strong><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Jin Ramen Mild Korean Style Instant Noodles</strong></a></strong><p>The last thing a sick person wants to do is put in effort. You are already putting what little energy you have into achieving that magical feeling where you can breathe through both nostrils at the same time, and that should be enough. That said, you still need to eat, and this delicious instant ramen is going to give you that warm, comforting, delicious soup your body and soul need without the hassle of boiling bones for hours. Jordan noted that this soup not only comes with “restaurant-quality noodles,” but the broth is also “spectacular” and comes in two different spice levels, both of which are great. Ramen is filling, comforting, and it’s always a reliable pick when you’re looking for the best soup for sickness. —Jessica Block</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=#>best instant ramen</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>MAMA Instant Noodles</strong></a><p>This is another pick from Jordan’s instant ramen ranking—and it’s another one of the best soups for when you are sick. In fact, this is the perfect chicken noodle soup for people who don’t eat meat, too. See, while this ramen may be chicken flavored, it is fully vegetarian. It also comes with everything you need to minimize prep and cook time so you can get back into bed asap. “You don’t need to add a single thing to these noodles. They are perfect as is,” Jordan gushed. —Naajia Shukri</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=#>best instant ramen</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFuv86up2aen6d6uLTEp2Syp6Wnsm6%2FyJyiaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./byron-allen-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Byron Allen Net Worth : Investment &amp;amp; Career">&larr;
