Well, there’s no assurance whether he will speak up or not about his sexual interests, but we can assume he is straight by looking at his love life.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s discover Timothée Chalamet’s sexuality and learn why he is misunderstood as gay by some fans.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Timothee_Chalamet_Was_Gay_in_His_Film_Call_Me_By_Your_Name><strong>Timothée Chalamet Was Gay in His Film ‘Call Me By Your Name&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><p>Before we learn whether Chalamet is gay or straight, it’s more important to know where the misconception of him being gay came from. So, the source of his gay rumors is the movie Call Me By Your Name, where Timothée Chalamet was in love with Armie Hammer.&nbsp;</p><p>The two even make out for a long time until they are told to stop. The two actors had great chemistry and seemed to enjoy each other as gay couples do. Both Chalamet and Hammer were interviewed several times after the movie was released.&nbsp;</p><p>Most of their interviews were very weird, where they admitted that the story was great and picked their attention. Since they not only acted in the film promoting homosexual love but also said it’s another beautiful human relationship, the statement made most of Timothée’s fans think he was gay.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Is_Timothee_Chalamet_Gay_in_Real_Life><strong>Is Timothée Chalamet Gay in Real Life?&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><p>It’s weird, but let us tell you the truth, 80% of straight actors play gay roles, but only a few gay actors play straight person roles. Now it should help you understand that Timothée Chalamet is not gay.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides, all the gay celebrities have already come out of the closet and are now openly gay. We didn’t find evidence where the ‘Dune’ actor mentioned himself as gay. Also, no media reports showed his affair or closeness with men outside of his career life.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s unfair and a crime to think someone is gay without proof. So it’s better not to trust rumors until we find him declaring his sexual orientation as homosexual.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Timothee_Chalamet_is_Straight_and_His_Relationship_History_is_the_Evidence><strong>Timothée Chalamet is Straight, and His Relationship History is the Evidence</strong></span></h2><p>Timothée Chalamet is also prominent for being an open person about his relationships. He dated several high-profile stars and was captured many times dating them.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2013 he first sparked rumors of dating Lourdes Leon. The couple dated for four years. He didn’t share much information about the breakup, so no one knows why they split. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In a 2017 interview he talked about Leon.</a></p><p>In 2018 Chalamet and <a href=#>Lily-Rose Depp</a> began to date. They went to restaurants and enjoyed spending time together publicly. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The two were spotted and captured at that moment.</a> The two broke up in 2020. The pair again got involved in 2021&nbsp;</p><p>In April 2023, Timothée was spotted dancing with Sarah Talabi, who is a model from Nigeria. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The duo even kissed, and the video went viral on TikTok</a>. However, he has not confirmed being in a relationship with her.&nbsp;</p><p>In his dating life, he wasn’t spotted with men. He also seems to enjoy most of his time with girl groups. Besides, he was spotted kissing a lady and not a man. So his gay movie doesn’t make him gay in real life. Timothée Chalamet is straight, and his relationships are enough to prove that.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Final_Words><strong>Final Words</strong></span></h2><p>Celebrities who played gay characters in their lives had to go through criticism a lot. That’s not their only issue; their sexuality is also questioned. Like all the other actors who played gay roles, Timothée Chalamet’s sexuality is also doubted.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem is that he didn’t label his sexuality, so the confusion is not going away quickly. But the number of celebrities with no sexual label is enormous. So most stars’ gender orientation is assumed through analyzing their dating life. We analyzed Chalamet’s, and the result said he is not gay.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FHmqynrF6YvK57yKxkraGdpMGpscRmmqGZnJa6psCMoJiyZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./suspicious-series-of-brush-fires-in-central-maui-under-investigation.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Suspicious series of brush fires in Central Maui under investigation | News, Sports, Jobs">&larr;
