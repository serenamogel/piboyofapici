His father worked in the coal industry, and his mother was a nurse.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Country music heavily influenced the area where Childers grew up. Nearby Route 23, about 20 minutes away, is known as Kentucky’s Country Music Highway, with artists like Dwight Yoakam, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/loretta-lynn data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Loretta Lynn" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Loretta Lynn</a>, and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/chris-stapleton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Chris Stapleton" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Chris Stapleton</a> once calling the region home. Childers would eventually add his name to the list of local greats, but his path there wasn’t always easy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The singer was born with clubfoot, a congenital disorder that caused both of his feet to twist out of shape. He underwent surgeries to correct the condition at 8 months and 5 years old—once spending an entire year in a wheelchair—and had to relearn how to walk. He also attended regular checkups at Shriners Children’s hospital in Lexington until he was 18.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Childers has described himself as a “very sensitive child.” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://bittersoutherner.com/feature/2023/the-evolution-of-tyler-childers-by-silas-house data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="He told The Bitter Southerner" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">He told The Bitter Southerner</a> that although he was raised with his sister and surrounded by family and cousins, he often felt isolated. He was active in his church group but said the fire-and-brimstone teachings he received caused him emotional stress. “I don’t think my mom and dad… went, ‘We’re going to take him [to church] on Sundays and Wednesdays and scare him to death,’ but that’s what it did,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://bittersoutherner.com/feature/2023/the-evolution-of-tyler-childers-by-silas-house data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="he said" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">he said</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Especially during his physical recovery, Childers found comfort in books and initially aspired to be a writer.

He sang for his Free Will Baptist Church congregation, learned to play chords on a guitar from his grandfather, and began writing songs when he was around 13. His favorite genres included <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/rock-musicians data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="classic rock" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">classic rock</a>, which his father often listened to, and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/g45702018/famous-country-singers/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=country class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">country</a>, including artists like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/hank-williams-jr data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Hank Williams Jr." class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Hank Williams Jr.</a>, Ricky Skaggs, and Alabama.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When he was 15, Childers transferred to Paintsville High School and often played his guitar at lunch to feel more comfortable. His classmates soon invited him to sing at parties and began introducing him to other forms of music. Childers graduated in 2009 and briefly studied at Western Kentucky University and Bluegrass Community & Technical College but ultimately dropped out of school to take odd jobs and fund his music dreams.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Learn About Other Country Music Stars</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=22 title="Albums and Songs: “In Your Love,” “All Your’n,” and Long Violent History" data-anchor-id=albums-and-songs-in-your-love-all-yourn-and-long-violent-history class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Albums and Songs: “In Your Love,” “All Your’n,” and Long Violent History</h2><img alt="tyler childers smiles at the camera while standing in front of a tree, he wears a green graphic tshirt" title="Tyler Childers in August 2018 at Lollapalooza, where he was a performer" width=2002 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tyler-childers-poses-during-lollapalooza-2018-at-grant-park-news-photo-1710973851.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Tyler Childers in August 2018</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Childers began writing his own music and released his first album when he was 19. He built a minor following in Kentucky and West Virginia with his band, the Food Stamps, and caught the attention of Miles Miller, a drummer for Sturgill Simpson. The connection proved to be crucial for the next step in Childers’ career.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Simpson served as a co-producer for Childers’ second album Purgatory, released in August 2017. The singer achieved his first mainstream success, as the record debuted at No. 1 on the Heatseekers Albums chart—highlighting new and emerging artists—and No. 2 on the Americana/Folk Albums chart. It stayed on the latter for 261 weeks. As a result, Childers was named Emerging Artist of the Year at the 2018 Americana Honors & Awards.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Country Squire and “All Your’n”</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Childers charted even higher in 2019 with Country Squire, his major label debut with RCA.

The song also nabbed the singer his first Grammy nomination, for Best Country Solo Performance in 2020.</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Long Violent History</h2><img alt="tyler childers playing a guitar while performing at a concert in front of a giant american flag" title='"In Your Love" Singer Tyler Childers' width=1024 height=764 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tyler-childers-performs-in-concert-during-willie-nelsons-news-photo-1710960352.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Tyler Childers performs in Austin, Texas, in July 2022.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Despite country’s track record of love songs and party anthems, Childers showed a willingness to challenge listeners by addressing key social and political issues in his next projects. Upon the release of his 2020 album, Long Violent History, and its titular track that addresses racism and police brutality in its lyrics, Childers recorded an <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ3_AJ5Ysx0" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="accompanying YouTube message" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">accompanying YouTube message</a>.

Similarly, Can I Take My Hounds to Heaven?

That’s pretty powerful. Once you take away the flash card phrases and like the knee-jerk reactions, how does that make you feel?”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“In Your Love” was nominated for three Grammys—Best Country Song, Best Music Video, and Best Country Solo Performance—in 2024, and Childers earned additional nods for Best Country Album for Rustin’ In The Rain (2023) and Best Americana Performance for “Help Me Make It Through the Night.”</p><h2 data-node-id=37 title="Wife and Son" data-anchor-id=wife-and-son class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Wife and Son</h2><img alt="tyler childers posing with his wife senora may for a photo in front of a grammys backdrop" title="Tyler Childers and wife Senora May at a Grammy Awards gala" width=2470 height=3282 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/senora-may-tyler-childers-attend-the-66th-grammy-awards-pre-news-photo-1710960084.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Senora May and Tyler Childers, seen here in February 2024, have been married for nearly 10 years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While living and working on a Kentucky farm in 2013, Childers met Senora May, a recent college graduate who was cleaning houses in the area to make extra money. Their relationship quickly blossomed, and the couple married in July 2015.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Like Childers, May is a musician; she has released two albums, Lainheart in 2018 and All of My Love in 2021. The couple also started a charity together. In 2020, they founded the Hickman Holler Appalachian Relief Fund, which raises money for causes such as education, civil rights, and addiction recovery.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Childers has credited May for supporting him as he tried to build his singing career. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/who-is-senora-may-tyler-childers-wife-8424824 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="According to People" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">According to People</a>, they moved in with Childers’ family following their wedding to save enough money to purchase property for a home.
