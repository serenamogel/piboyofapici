They went on to have six children and stayed together until his death in 1996. The Lynns' complex marriage had its share of turmoil, infidelity and abuse, but it also provided love and support. Through all the ups and downs, it was the defining relationship of Loretta's life.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Loretta claimed that every time Doo 'smacked me, he got smacked twice'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Loretta's husband, whom she called "Doo," sent her back to her parents shortly after they'd tied the knot, despite her being pregnant at the time. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://books.google.com/books?id=HbIgGj1dMZUC&pg=PA53#v=onepage&q&f=false" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="According to Loretta" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">According to Loretta</a>, this happened as a result of Doo's interest in philandering. Yet even after they'd reconciled, and Loretta had warned the other woman to keep her distance, the marriage had plenty of problems.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">One issue was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/loretta-lynn-asks-whos-gonna-miss-me-when-im-gone data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=violence class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">violence</a>. Doo hit Loretta. On one occasion, after he'd been drinking, he smashed jars of green beans because his dinner was late. But Loretta has also <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/interviews/a2067/esq0102-jan-lynn/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=declared class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">declared</a>, "Every time Doo smacked me, he got smacked twice." During one fight, she emptied a skillet of creamed corn over her husband's head. Another time she struck him: "I heard teeth hittin' the floor and thought, 'Ooh, I'm dead. He not gonna put up with this.' But he laughed."</p><img alt="Loretta and Doo Lynn circa 1955" title="Loretta and Doo Lynn circa 1955" width=2505 height=3600 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/-loretta-lynn-poses-for-a-portrait-with-a-man-perhaps-her-husband-mooney-in-circa-1955-in-butcher-holler-kentucky-photo-by-michael-ochs-archivesgetty-images.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span><p>Doo and Loretta Lynn, circa 1955</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Doo helped Loretta launch her career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Loretta has always credited Doo with her country music career. It was Doo who gave her the guitar (a $17 purchase from Sears) on which she composed her first songs. And he was the one who prodded her to perform, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.timeout.com/chicago/music/loretta-lynn-interview data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="telling her" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">telling her</a>, "You're just as good or better as most of them girls that are singin' and makin' money, so let's make us some money." Without this encouragement, Loretta would not have acted. "I had never sang in front of anybody until my husband pushed me out there, you know," <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.wbur.org/npr/131097120/loretta-lynn-after-strife-a-full-life data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she said on Fresh Air" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">she said on Fresh Air</a> in 2010. "I was really bashful, and I would've never sang in front of anybody."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When her first single, "I'm a Honky Tonk Girl," came out, Doo helped with promotion. He traveled alongside Loretta as they visited radio stations attempting to get airtime for her song. "I could never have done it on my own," <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/still-woman-enough/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she wrote in her 2002 memoir" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">she wrote in her 2002 memoir</a>, Still Woman Enough. "Whatever else our marriage was back in them days...without Doo and his drive to get a better life, there would have been no Loretta Lynn, country singer."</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">He also inspired many of her songs</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In addition to jumpstarting Loretta's country career, Doo contributed to her success in another way: The troubles in their marriage inspired many of her songs. "I've never written a song that my husband wasn't in. Every song I wrote, but he didn't know which line he was in," <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/legends-loretta-lynn-tells-all/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she has stated" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">she has stated</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">One Doo-inspired tune was "Fist City." With it, Loretta was able to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://books.google.com/books?id=HbIgGj1dMZUC&pg=PA55#v=onepage&q&f=false" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=address class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">address</a> "a real woman in Tennessee who was making eyes at Doolittle while I was a-singing on the stage. I let her know she was gonna get a mouthful of knuckles if she kept it up." Loretta's fans found songs like these, with their take on marital difficulties from a woman's perspective, very relatable.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Despite Doo being unfaithful, Loretta believed 'if you can't fight for your man, he's not worth having'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Loretta became a country music superstar, and she and Doo acquired a large house and estate. It was a big change from when she'd taken just about any job around to help support her family: cooking for ranch hands, picking berries and scrubbing houses. Yet with success came other difficulties. Loretta spent a lot of time touring, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/article/13004989/a-survivors-tale data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="and when she returned" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">and when she returned</a>, "I never knew what I was comin' home to. I didn’t know if I was comin' home to fightin' or what. It was pretty rough. Doo drank a lot. There was a lot of times I'd have rather not come home. And if it hadn't have been for my babies, I wouldn't have."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Doo hadn't been faithful early in their marriage, and his infidelities continued while Loretta was on the road. He'd even invite women into their home while his wife was away. Yet through it all, she stuck with her husband. "I put up with it because of six kids," <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/still-woman-enough/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she once explained" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">she once explained</a>. "And I loved him and he loved me." <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://time.com/4246104/loretta-lynn/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="She also believed" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">She also believed</a>, "If you can't fight for your man, he's not worth having."</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Loretta put her career on hold to take care of Doo on his deathbed</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Doo had heart surgery in 1992. Complications from diabetes then led to the amputation of both his legs. Through it all, Loretta, having put her career on hold, was there to take care of him. In 1996, Doo passed away at the age of 69. The loss hit Loretta hard. "Three days after my husband died, I left Hurricane Mills and come to Nashville," <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/article/13004989/a-survivors-tale data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she said in an interview in 2000" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">she said in an interview in 2000</a>. "After bein' here awhile, I said to a friend of mine, 'It seems like I been here a couple months already.' And she said, 'You been here a year.'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Loretta eventually resumed her career. But Doo's death left a void in her life. Her daughter Patsy <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/loretta-lynn-honky-tonk-woman-187968/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told Rolling Stone in 2004" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told Rolling Stone in 2004</a>, "I don't think she has totally accepted my dad's loss. It's almost like he's gone on a long vacation or something."
