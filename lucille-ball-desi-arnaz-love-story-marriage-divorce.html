But that didn’t stop <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/lucille-ball data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lucille Ball" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Lucille Ball</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/desi-arnaz data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Desi Arnaz" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Desi Arnaz</a> from becoming America’s favorite on- and off-screen couple.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Their union would go on to produce two children, as well as countless hours of groundbreaking television. They would help usher in the era of syndicated broadcasting and their production company, Desilu Pictures, would back such influential series as The Dick Van Dyke Show, Mission: Impossible and Star Trek.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Though marriage for the couple would last only two decades, a love and mutual respect remained between the stars until death. “They had a great divorce,” daughter Lucie Arnaz <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/lucille-ball-and-desi-arnazs-daughter-talks-legacy-of-i-love-lucy/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="recalled to Closer Weekly in 2019" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">recalled to Closer Weekly in 2019</a>. “They had a very successful divorce. It was fantastic. … If their parents can’t get along and that happens, then kids should be so lucky to have a divorce like my mom and dad because they were kind. They never said bad words about each other and they stayed friends until the day they died. It was a fantastic romance that got even more passionate and friendlier after they were not married to each other anymore.”</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">People made bets on how long Ball and Arnaz's marriage would last</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Arnaz and Ball met in 1940 on the set of the RKO movie Too Many Girls. He was a 23-year-old bandleader whose family had fled Cuba in 1933. At 28, Ball was a seasoned studio contract player whose star power had never been fit to the right vehicle. Their offscreen chemistry was evident and they had eloped by year’s end. “You could tell the sparks were flying with Lucy,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/archive/lucille-ball-desi-arnaz-vol-45-no-6/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="said Eddie Bracken" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">said Eddie Bracken</a>, a co-star from the film. “It happened so fast it seemed it wouldn’t last. Everybody on the set made bets about how long it would last.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Tumultuous from the very beginning, Ball first sought to exit the marriage in 1944 when she filed for divorce, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/archive/lucille-ball-desi-arnaz-vol-45-no-6/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=reportedly class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">reportedly</a> over Arnaz’s infidelities and heavy drinking. His touring schedule required extended absences from his new wife. When at home his performances would keep Arnaz away into the early hours of the morning, while Ball’s studio schedule often meant she was preparing to go to work at the time he returned home.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After talking it through they reconciled. Endeavoring to spend more time together, Ball and Arnaz searched for projects that would allow them to team up on a professional as well as personal level. That project would ultimately be I Love Lucy, the Emmy-winning sitcom that would run from 1951 to 1957, changing the television landscape forever and making the couple household names.</p><img alt="Lucille Ball and her husband Desi Arnaz arrive at London Airport with their children Lucie and Desi Jr" title="Lucille Ball and her husband Desi Arnaz arrive at London Airport with their children Lucie and Desi Jr" width=5025 height=3767 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/lucille-ball-and-her-husband-desi-arnaz-arrive-at-london-airport-with-their-children-lucie-and-desi-jr-10th-june-1959-they-have-just-arrived-from-naples-for-a-three-day-visit-photo-by-j-wildskeystoneh.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: J. Wilds:Keystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span><p>Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz arrive in London with their children, Desi Jr. and Lucie, in June 1959</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Ball insisted that Arnaz played her TV husband</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">CBS wanted Ball to recreate on television the success she had achieved on radio with My Favorite Husband (1947–1950), a series about a ditzy newlywed and her madcap adventures. But the network initially balked when Ball demanded any show she would appear in must also include real-life husband Arnaz. Executives at CBS were reportedly worried that American audiences wouldn’t accept Arnaz’s strong accent.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Sticking to their demands, Ball and Arnaz opted to take a similar-themed, Vaudeville-style stage show on the road instead, much to the delight of theater audiences. The live show a success, CBS relented and Ball and Arnaz went on to create and star in I Love Lucy, a weekly sitcom about a young couple, Lucy and Ricky Ricardo, and their friends and neighbors Fred (William Frawley) and Ethel (Vivian Vance) Mertz. Often taking story cues from their own lives, the onscreen appeal of the couple and Ball’s comedic stylings propelled the series to become the No. 1 show in America four years running, then number two and number three respectively over its six-year run.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As the couple prepared to launch the show into American homes, Ball gave birth to the couple’s only daughter, Lucie Arnaz, in 1951. Two years later, as I Love Lucy was riding high atop the ratings, their only son, Desi Arnaz Jr., would appear in utero in the series when Ball became one of the first pregnant women ever to appear on primetime – a shock in an era where Lucy and Ricky were depicted as sleeping in separate beds and the word “pregnant” was deemed by the network to be too distasteful for primetime audiences. Ball gave birth to her son on January 19, 1953, the same day her character gave birth on the series.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Ball believed it 'would be better for us not to be together'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Pregnancy and children were things Ball had longed for, with the actress reportedly suffering several miscarriages before conceiving daughter Lucie. But as audiences tuned in each week to witness her latest, often outrageous adventures, Ball’s marriage to Arnaz was under strain. He was working 14-hour days as their Hollywood careers skyrocketed, but at home, the stress played out as verbal sparring and accusations of further infidelity by Arnaz. But like the series itself, in which Lucy and Ricky would make up just before the credits rolled, so too did Ball and Arnaz find common ground in their relationship time and time again.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At one point during their marriage, “the magazine Confidential came out with a story saying Desi was a womanizer,” recalls Charles Pomerantz, Ball’s longtime publicist, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/archive/cover-story-vanessas-story-vol-22-no-6/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="according to People" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">according to People</a>. “I gave an advance copy to Desi, and Lucy said, ‘I want to read this story.’ It was during a rehearsal day, and she went into her dressing room. Everybody was frozen on the set. She finally came out, tossed the magazine to Desi and said, ‘Oh, hell, I could tell them worse than that.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But Arnaz’s drinking and philandering continued and the couple divorced in 1960. “It got so bad that I thought it would be better for us not to be together,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/tv/lucille-ball-desi-arnaz-divorce-horrible-says-daughter/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ball said in court" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ball said in court</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The pair never 'got over' their split and remained friends</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Though now apart, they continued to work together at Desilu. Two years following their divorce, as Ball readied herself to return to weekly television with The Lucy Show, Arnaz was struggling with the pressures of running Desilu. In 1962 Ball paid Arnaz a reported $2.5 million for his company shares and became the first female CEO of a major Hollywood production studio, steering Desilu to greater success before selling the company in 1967 to Gulf + Western/Paramount for $17.5 million.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Both would go on to remarry: Ball to comedian Gary Morton in 1962 and Arnaz to Edith Hirsch in 1963. Arnaz died December 2, 1986, at age 69 from lung cancer. Ball passed away three years later on April 26 due to an aortic rupture. But their love and respect for each endured while alive, and can be still be seen and appreciated in reruns of I Love Lucy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Maybe I’m the romantic, but there was a great, great love there, there really was,” I Love Lucy director William Asher <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/archive/cover-story-the-real-story-of-desi-and-lucy-vol-35-no-6/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told People" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told People</a>. “Desi was very unhappy about the breakup, and I think she was too. I don’t think either one of them ever got over it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyfp8BwuNScoKWklWKvorjLZpueq5lirrO6wLNkpaemmnq0wM6rsGalkae%2Fqq3GnmSdoaakv6Sx</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-ahkeema-zion-williamsons-girlfriend-643436-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Ahkeema, Zion Williamsons girlfriend?">&larr;
