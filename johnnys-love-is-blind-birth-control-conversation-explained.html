One overarching problem keeps rearing its head for the blossoming couple, and it may be enough to ruin their chances.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=460 data-current-count=460 data-injectable=true>Johnny and Amy have easily experienced <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the least drama</a> of this season’s pack. While <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kenneth is icing out Brittany</a>, Jeramy is chatting up Sarah Ann until all hours of the morning, and Jimmy and Chelsea continue to slowly melt into a puddle of insecurity and poor communication, Johnny and Amy are largely thriving. They’ve got a strong connection, they’re eagerly looking forward to marriage, and they really only have one hiccup to overcome.</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=225 data-injectable=false>Unfortunately, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">its a pretty big hiccup</a>. The pair have been stumbling over one particular hurdle since essentially the start of their relationship, and it might present a big enough barrier to stop their wedding in its tracks.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-birth-control-issue data-injectable=false>The birth control issue</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=525 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Amy Tiffany (@amytiffany)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>A non-contentious, but still troubling, issue around birth control is presenting the only real barrier between Johnny and Amy and their happily ever after, but it’s becoming a real problem for the pair. The crux of the issue is a common one in straight relationships — neither half of the couple wants kids just yet, and they’d like to prevent an accidental pregnancy at all costs.</p><p data-characters=571 data-current-count=962 data-injectable=true>There’s a simple solution to this, I hear many of you screaming from the sidelines, but it’s rarely cropped up in conversations between Johnny and Amy. Condoms are 98% effective against unplanned pregnancy when used correctly, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the Cleveland Clinic</a>, and they’re widely available. Always using condoms and being careful in their application would hugely reduce Johnny and Amy’s risk of getting pregnant — even used incorrectly, they’re still more than 85% effective — but they’re interested in taking things a step further.</p><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=true>Johnny and Amy are looking to either hormonal birth control or a vasectomy to ensure their family plan stays on the schedule they’d like. Both of these methods of birth control are even more effective than condoms, and come close to guaranteeing that no unplanned pregnancies will come as a result of their pairing. Both have side effects and risks, however, and neither Amy nor Johnny are overly keen on being the one to bite the bullet.</p><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>For Amy, its due to a rare genetic disorder that could be complicated by the use of hormonal birth control. Hormonal birth control <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">already has a litany of side-effects</a>, including headaches, nausea, sore breasts, yeast infections, mood swings, a lowered sexual desire, and — most importantly — an increased risk of blood clots. This risk is heightened in people like Amy, who have a history of vascular issues in the family.</p><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=267 data-injectable=false>The most appealing alternative, then, would be a vasectomy, but Johnny doesn’t seem overly keen on the idea. While he did initially consider the possibility, once he found out about its risks, he decided he wasn’t willing to go through with the procedure.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Why is Johnny so opposed to a vasectomy?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Johnny McIntyre (@johnny__mcintyre)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=584 data-current-count=584 data-injectable=true>Most forms of medical birth control come with some degree of risk, but vasectomies are overall quite safe, and generally sport fewer side effects than hormonal birth control. Vasectomies are generally very safe, but — as all medical procedures carry some degree of risk — they are not completely without potential hurdles. The most <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">common side effect of a vasectomy is infection</a>, but those instances are rare, and typically quite minor. Men also often experience soreness, swelling, and sometimes bruising following the procedure, but all of these clear up within just a few days.</p><p data-characters=454 data-current-count=454 data-injectable=true>The biggest issue is that vasectomies are not reversible 100% of the time. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stanford Healthcare</a>, “the effectiveness of a vasectomy reversal is up to 90-95 percent,” which leaves between a 5 and 10% chance of the procedure not being reversible. That up to 10% chance, along with learning more about the procedure itself, was enough to turn Johnny off the idea of getting clipped, which lands hi. and Amy back in a complicated spot.</p><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=true>Amy has said that she’s willing to consider birth control, but the risks to her health may be enough to prevent her from taking that route. If she decides the risks aren’t worth the reward, it seems she and Johnny are left with only one option: Condoms. They aren’t entirely effective 100% of the time, but if Johnny and Amy want to make their relationship work, they may be the only option left to them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Johnny and Amy’s reunion response</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Johnny-Amy-BC.jpg><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=749 data-injectable=true>Hilariously, Johnny and Amy were forced to address the condom conversation during <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Love is Blind season 6 reunion</a>. Addressing a question from season 1 participant Gigi, Johnny explained that condoms were always on the back burner of discussions over birth control. They weren’t frequently shown on screen, but he and Amy did chat about condoms as a means to birth control, they were just interested in exploring other, more secure options.</p><p data-characters=467 data-current-count=467 data-injectable=true>Amy added that she never went on birth control and Johnny never got a vasectomy, and the pair are still happily childfree. It seems condoms have worked out so far, but that hasn’t saved the pair from taking flak for their fixation on other birth control options. Johnny was even forced to re-address the issue via his Instagram story, where he went to assure fans that “Yes, I do know what a condom is, and yes, I did pass high school health class.”</p><p data-characters=480 data-current-count=480 data-injectable=false>Johnny went on to explain that he any Amy discussed their family plan at length, and both were adamant from the start that they not be forced to change their bodies’ chemistry. That’s what led to those endless birth control conversations, but they’ve thankfully found a solution. He used the opportunity to plug a business the pair are currently working with, and so long as it works for them, we’re happy they found a way around the birth control discussion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8mon6emqah6rbvVnmSiq12Xuaq6w2aZoqqknXqku82tqaikXZi8r8LEq6qarJmku26x16mjmqGemrFw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tj-lavins-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-life-story.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="TJ Lavins biography, fact, career, awards, net worth &amp;amp; life story">&larr;
