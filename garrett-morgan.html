He began his career as a sewing-machine mechanic before patenting an improved sewing machine design and a hair-straightening product, among other inventions. His breathing device, known as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/inventors/a46820069/garrett-morgan-safety-hood-cleveland-tunnel-disaster/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="a safety hood" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">a safety hood</a>, later provided the blueprint for World War I gas masks. In 1923, Morgan invented a safer traffic light. The notable <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/black-inventors data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Black inventor" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Black inventor</a>, who lived much of his life in Ohio, died in July 1963 at age 86.</p><h2 data-node-id=4 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Garrett Augustus Morgan<br>BORN: March 4, 1877<br>DIED: July 27, 1963<br>BIRTHPLACE: Paris, Kentucky<br>SPOUSES: Madge Nelson (1896-1898) and Mary Hasek (1908-1963)<br>CHILDREN: John, Garrett, and Cosmo<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Pisces</p><h2 data-node-id=6 title="Early Life " data-anchor-id=early-life class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Born in Paris, Kentucky, on March 4, 1877, Garrett Augustus Morgan was the seventh of 11 children. His mother, Elizabeth Reed, was of Indian and African descent and the daughter of a Baptist minister. His father, Sydney, a formerly enslaved man freed in 1863, was the son of John Hunt Morgan, a Confederate colonel. Morgan’s mixed-race heritage would play a part in his business dealings as an adult.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When Morgan was in his mid-teens, he moved to Cincinnati to look for work and found it as a handyman to a wealthy landowner. Although he only completed an elementary school education, Morgan paid for more lessons from a private tutor. Jobs at several sewing-machine factories soon captured his imagination and helped determined his future.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 title="Inventions: Traffic Light, Early Gas Mask, and More" data-anchor-id=inventions-traffic-light-early-gas-mask-and-more class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Inventions: Traffic Light, Early Gas Mask, and More</h2><img alt="black and white photo of garrett morgan, he looks at the camera and wears a wool jacket, collared shirt and tie, he has a medal on his jacket lapel" title="Garrett Morgan" width=796 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/portrait-of-garrett-a-morgan-circa-1875-news-photo-1706891367.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Inventor Garrett Morgan</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">One of Morgan’s first inventions involved the sewing machine. After learning the inner workings of the machines and how to fix them at his factory jobs, Morgan obtained a patent for an improved sewing machine and opened his own repair business. Morgan’s business was a success; it enabled him to marry his second wife, Mary Hasek, and establish himself in Cleveland. Following the momentum of his business success, Morgan’s patented sewing machine soon paved the way to his financial freedom, albeit in a rather unorthodox way.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Hair Straightener</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1909, Morgan was working with sewing machines in his newly opened tailoring shop—a business he had opened with Mary, who had experience as a seamstress—when he encountered woolen fabric that had been scorched by a sewing-machine needle. It was a common problem at the time since sewing-machine needles ran at such high speeds. In hopes of alleviating the problem, Morgan experimented with a chemical solution in an effort to reduce friction created by the needle and subsequently noticed that the hairs of the cloth were straighter.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After trying his solution to good effect on a neighboring dog’s fur, Morgan finally tested the concoction on himself. When that worked, he quickly established the G.A. Morgan Hair Refining Company and sold the cream to African Americans. The company was incredibly successful, bringing Morgan financial security and allowing him to pursue other interests.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Read About Other Famous Black Inventors</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 id="'Safety-Hood'-Invention" data-node-id=17 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Safety Hood: Precursor to the World War I Gas Mask</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1914, Morgan patented a breathing device, or “safety hood,” providing its wearers with a safer breathing experience in the presence of smoke, gases, and other pollutants. Morgan worked hard to market the device, especially to fire departments, often personally demonstrating its reliability in fires. Morgan’s breathing device became the prototype and precursor for the gas masks used during <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-i data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="World War I" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">World War I</a>, protecting soldiers from <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/news/world-war-i-gas-chemical-weapons data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="toxic gas used in warfare" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">toxic gas used in warfare</a>. The invention earned him the first prize at the Second International Exposition of Safety and Sanitation in New York City.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">There was some resistance to Morgan’s devices among buyers, particularly in the South, where racial tension remained palpable despite advancements in civil rights for Black Americans. In an effort to counteract the resistance to his products, Morgan hired a white actor to pose as “the inventor” during presentations of his breathing device. Morgan then posed as the inventor’s sidekick, disguised as a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/native-americans data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Native American" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Native American</a> man named Big Chief Mason. Wearing his hood, Morgan entered areas otherwise unsafe for breathing. The tactic was successful. Sales of the device were quick to materialize, especially from firefighters and rescue workers.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Traffic Light</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The voracious inventor didn’t stop with his early gas mask design. His penchant for fixing problems turned his attention to all kinds of things, from hats to belt fasteners to car parts. The first Black man in Cleveland to own a car, Morgan worked on his mechanical skills and developed a friction drive clutch.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Then, in 1923, he created a new kind of traffic signal, one with a warning light to alert drivers that they would need to stop. He invented the device after witnessing a carriage accident at a particularly problematic intersection in Cleveland. Morgan quickly acquired patents for his traffic signal—a rudimentary version of the modern three-way traffic light—in the United States, Britain, and Canada but eventually sold the rights to General Electric for $40,000.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Despite poor health in his later years, Morgan continued work on inventions. His last was a self-extinguishing cigarette that had a water-filled plastic pellet placed just before the filter.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=24 title="Cleveland Tunnel Explosion" data-anchor-id=cleveland-tunnel-explosion class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Cleveland Tunnel Explosion</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A tragic accident in 1916 proved to be another opportunity for Morgan and his safety hood to come to the rescue. That year, the city of Cleveland was drilling a new tunnel under Lake Erie for a fresh water supply. Workers hit a pocket of natural gas, which resulted in a huge explosion that trapped workers underground amid suffocating noxious fumes and dust.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When Morgan heard about the explosion, he and his brother put on breathing devices and made their way into the tunnel as quickly as possible. The brothers managed to save two lives and recover four bodies before the rescue effort was shut down.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">The Full Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Despite his heroic efforts, the publicity that Morgan garnered from the incident hurt sales. The public was now fully aware that Morgan was Black, and many refused to purchase his products. Adding to the detriment, neither the inventor nor his brother were fully recognized for their heroic efforts at Lake Erie—possibly another effect of racial discrimination. Morgan was nominated for a Carnegie Medal for his efforts but ultimately wasn’t chosen to receive the award. Additionally, some reports of the explosion named others as the rescuers.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=29 title="Social Activism" data-anchor-id=social-activism class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Social Activism</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Outside of his inventing career, Morgan diligently supported the African American community throughout his lifetime. He was a member of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/web-du-bois-naacp data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the newly formed NAACP" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">the newly formed NAACP</a>, was active in the Cleveland Association of Colored Men, donated to Black colleges, and opened an all-Black country club. Additionally, in 1920, he launched the Cleveland Call, an African American newspaper later named the Call and Post.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Dive Deeper</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=32 title="Wives and Children" data-anchor-id=wives-and-children class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Wives and Children</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Morgan was married twice and a father to three sons.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His first marriage was with Madge Nelson. Little is documented about their union, which began in 1896 and ended only two years later.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Morgan had a much more substantial relationship with his second wife, Mary Hasek, whom he married in 1908. They had three children together: John, Garrett, and Cosmo.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hasek’s family had immigrated to the United States from the modern day Czech Republic in 1893, and Mary found work as a sewer in a tailor ship. As a white woman, her relationship with Morgan was met with derision. After their marriage, Mary’s father had her excommunicated from the Catholic church, meaning her siblings had to visit her in secrecy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The Morgans valued family time and hosted dinner in their home in Cleveland every Sunday night (with attendance mandatory). Garrett Sr. also heavily invested in his sons’ education, offering them opportunities unavailable in his youth.</p><h2 data-node-id=38 title="Later Years and Death" data-anchor-id=later-years-and-death class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Later Years and Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Morgan began developing glaucoma in 1943 and lost most of his sight as a result. He suffered from other health problems, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://w3.ric.edu/faculty/rpotter/morgan.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="which he believed" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">which he believed</a> were attributed to toxins present at the Cleveland tunnel disaster. Just before his death, Morgan was honored by the U.S. government for his traffic signal invention.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The accomplished inventor died in Cleveland on July 27, 1963, after battling “a lingering illness,” according to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/2022/02/garrett-a-morgan-clevelands-black-edison-created-todays-traffic-light-and-gas-mask-black-history-months-untold-stories.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="his obituary" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">his obituary</a> in the Pittsburgh Courier.

And he was eventually restored to his place in history as a hero of the Lake Erie rescue. His work provided the blueprint for many important advancements that came later and continues to inspire and serve as a basis for research conducted by modern-day inventors and engineers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2005, Morgan was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in Akron, Ohio. His prototype traffic signal is on display at the African American Museum in Cleveland, and the Garrett Morgan School of Engineering and Innovation in the city is named in his honor.<br></p>Fact Check: We strive for accuracy and fairness.
