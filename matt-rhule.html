Although as per Fowler, Rhule was hired because of his ability to rebuild programs quickly at Temple and Baylor.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><h2>Matt Rhule LSU</h2><p>A new potential candidate for the LSU head coaching position emerged. The Fox Sports reporter Joel Klatt stated before that day on The Herd with Colin Cowherd he had been told that current Carolina Panthers head coach Matt Rhule may not be all the way in on the NFL going forward and that he may want to come back down to the college level.

Right now, Mel Tucker, Lane Kiffin, Luke Fickell, and James Franklin are the highlighted names LSU may be looking at according to media reports.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Rhule was to be another strong addition to that list.

What Rhule did so well at the two college programs he stopped was built them. The Temple went 2-10 in his first season. In his last, 10-3. He was 1-11 in his first year with the Bears.
