Craig began his career in Australia and New Zealand’s National Basketball League (NBL) before making it to the NBA.</strong></p><p><strong>While playing for the USC Upstate Spartans, he was an honorable mention All-American and Atlantic Sun Conference Player of the Year in 2012. Torrey spent his first three professional seasons after graduating from USC Upstate in 2014 in Australia and New Zealand. He was named New Zealand NBL MVP and won a New Zealand NBL championship with the Wellington Saints.</strong></p><p>He was also named NBL Best Defensive Player while playing for the Brisbane Bullets. In 2017, the athlete made his NBA debut with the Denver Nuggets.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Torrey_Craig_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Torrey Craig? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Torrey Craig has an estimated net worth of <strong>$5 million</strong>. He signed a two-year, $10 million contract with the Pacers this offseason, but the Pacers finished last in the Eastern Conference and decided to reload at the trade deadline. The contract calls for a straight swap for Craig’s $4.9 million salary this season.</p><p>Furthermore, during his time with the Pacers, Torrey Craig agreed to terms on a two-year, $10,000,000 contract with the Pacers, with $10,000,000 guaranteed and an annual average salary of $5,000,000.As an athlete, he should also be involved in various endorsement and sponsorship projects that contribute to his wealth.</p><h2><span id=Where_was_Torrey_Craig_born_Ethnicity_Nationality_Family_Education>Where was Torrey Craig born? Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</span></h2><p>Craig’s parents are Johnny Craig and Teresa Mays. Furthermore, he has a brother and a sister. Torrey Craig, who grew up in rural South Carolina, was unable to attend basketball camps as a child. As a result, he was overjoyed to see his son Braylon compete against much older students at Spartanburg Christian Academy.</p><p>His son, Braylon, was born on June 4, 2014. Braylon is tall for his age, but he is short, possibly the shortest at camp. But there he was, trying to stop a big kid on a fish and shark fast-break drill. To be honest, Braylon is unconcerned about the experience. He’s traveled the globe. He’s already seen more of the world than the majority of us will. The world is a blue-and-brown basketball to him.</p><p>His favorite player is former Marquette star, Dwyane Wade. He wore No. 3 for the Bucks, which was Wade’s number with Marquette, the Miami Heat, and the Chicago Bulls.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><table style="width:80%;margin:0 auto" width=100%><tbody><tr><td><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td width=468>Torrey Craig</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nickname</strong></td><td>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Date</strong></td><td class=infobox-data>December 19, 1990</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Place</strong></td><td width=468>Columbia, South Carolina</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Residence</strong></td><td>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Religion</strong></td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ethnicity</strong></td><td width=468>African American</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Education</strong></td><td class="infobox-data plainlist">Great Falls, USC Upstate</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Zodiac Sign</strong></td><td>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Father’s Name</strong></td><td width=468>Johnny Craig</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mother’s Name</strong></td><td width=468>Teresa May</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Siblings</strong></td><td width=468>2, brother and sister</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>31 years old</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height</strong></td><td width=468>6 feet 7 inches</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td width=468>221 lb (100kg)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Eye Color</strong></td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hair Color</strong></td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Body Type</strong></td><td>Athletic</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>Basketball Player</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Marital Status</strong></td><td>Single</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Girlfriend</strong></td><td width=468>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Children</strong></td><td>Braylon (son)</td></tr><tr><td><b>Active since</b></td><td>2014–present</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Teams</strong></td><td class=infobox-data><ul><li>Cairns Taipans</li><li>Wellington Saints</li><li>Brisbane Bullets</li><li>Gold Coast Rollers</li><li>Denver Nuggets</li><li>Sioux Falls Skyforce</li><li>Milwaukee Bucks</li><li>Phoenix Suns</li><li>Indiana Pacers</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Achievements</strong></td><td><ul><li>NBL Best Defensive Player (2017)</li><li>All-NBL Second Team (2017)</li><li>NZNBL champion (2016)</li><li>NZNBL Most Outstanding Guard (2015)</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Endorsements&nbsp;</strong></td><td>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td>$5 million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>NBA Draft Pick</strong></td><td class=infobox-data>2014/Undrafted</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Position</strong></td><td>Small Forward</td></tr><tr><td><strong>League</strong></td><td>NBA</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Merch</strong></td><td>Notebook and Cards</td></tr><tr><td><b>Social Media&nbsp;</b></td><td>Instagram,&nbsp;Twitter</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Last Update</strong></td><td>September 2022</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=How_tall_is_Torrey_Craig_Weight_Hair_Color>How tall is Torrey Craig?
