Contemporaneous Egyptian codices reference the game as a reflection of the soul's movement through Duat, the Egyptian plane of the dead. Archaeological evidence appears to confirm this acquired meaning, as boards from about 1300 BCE onward replaced the basic squares of the early senet boards with hieroglyphic birds associated with the Egyptian soul.</description></item><item><title>White Chocolate Almond Butter Cups</title><link>/white-chocolate-matcha-almond-butter-cups.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/white-chocolate-matcha-almond-butter-cups.html</guid><description>holiday
