The late wrestler mentioned his son’s health issue in his autobiography, Tangled Ropes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/geniuscelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Billy-Graham-Children.jpg><p>As reported MedicalNewsToday, double pneumonia is an infection of both lungs. The tiny sacs of the lungs (alveoli) become inflamed and fill with fluid or pus due to a virus, bacteria, or fungus, leading to a wide range of symptoms, including breathing difficulties.</p><p>Moreover, <a href=# rel=noopener>Mayo Clinic</a> reported an enlarged heart condition called idiopathic cardiomyopathy. The heart muscle can enlarge and weaken due to heart structure and function issues.</p><p>Thankfully, Joey’s health issues were subsequently corrected with surgery.</p><p>Furthermore, the Graham siblings prefer their life away from the media limelight. They are leading their life away from the spotlight.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, not much is known about the wrestler’s children. It is unknown what their professions are. However, they have already grown up. So, both Joey and Capella must have a family of their own.</p><p>Hopefully, we will learn more about the legendary wrestler’s son and daughter in the coming days.</p><p><strong>Related Story:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>Billy Graham Wrestler Cause of Death and Obituary: Did He Die of Infection?</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiflaO2tr%2FCnqOemqNjsLC5jrCpnqukobKzecGio6WxXZy%2ForTApmScoJmhsbOxzWaqqJmemXqlrdSgn62domQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./mark-knopfler-net-worth-168120.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mark Knopfler Net Worth">&larr;
