Some people (including Brady) believe that fruits and vegetables in the nightshade group cause inflammation (specifically arthritis) but there is no medical evidence that supports that.</span></span><h2>Why did Tom Brady avoid nightshades?</h2>So, why does Brady leave them out? Brady and his famous family will not eat fruits and vegetables that fall into the nightshade category. Brady argues that his diet is focused on keeping inflammation in the body low. He believes that plants in the nightshade category cause inflammation.<h2>Why do athletes avoid tomatoes?</h2>The reason he has all these food restrictions — and even vilifies tomatoes — is because he follows an anti-inflammatory diet, and one made up of mostly “alkaline” foods. An anti-inflammatory diet, Brady suggests, explains his success as an athlete: Some younger players don't give too much thought to nutrition.<h2>What foods does Tom Brady not eat?</h2>The Tom Brady diet—also known as the TB12 diet—is a high-protein, plant-based diet that excludes gluten, dairy, corn, soy, MSG, coffee, alcohol, GMOs, sugar, trans fats, overly processed foods, and more. Some fruits and vegetables such as nightshades are off-limits, as are certain oils.<h2>Why does Tom Brady not eat strawberries?</h2>“I just don't like them. At the end of the day, I just don't like the taste,” Brady told People. “I don't like the smell, the texture or anything. It doesn't really have to do with my diet, it's just more of my preference, but somehow it got wrapped into my diet.”<h2>Why Tom Brady HATES Tomatoes...And So Should You (The Lectin Detox)</h2><p></p><h2>Are tomatoes inflammatory?</h2>This is because tomatoes naturally produce a toxin called solanine. This toxin is believed to contribute to inflammation, swelling, and joint pain. However, no relationship between arthritis pain and tomatoes — or any of its cousins like potato and eggplant —has been found. So how did this myth get started?<h2>Does Tom Brady eat pizza?</h2>The 43-year-old quarterback is famous for promoting a plant-based diet and the proliferation of avocado ice cream. But even he has cheat meals. “He loves pizza and I would say that he loves a really great cheeseburger,” Guerrero said.<h2>Why are nightshades inflammatory?</h2>Some diets claim that nightshades are inflammatory and should be avoided. This idea is rooted in the fact that nightshades are a large family of plants that contain a chemical compound called alkaloids. In extremely high doses, some alkaloids can make inflammation worse or be poisonous.<h2>Does Tom Brady eat peanut butter?</h2>If Brady gets hungry between meals, he relies on hummus, guacamole or mixed nuts. Gameday is different in that Brady consumes a smoothie, as well as an almond butter and peanut butter jelly sandwich, which fuel him on the football field.<h2>Does Tom Brady eat popcorn?</h2>Candy. Cheese. Corn (all of it, including things like popcorn, corn oil and cornbread) Crackers.<h2>Are cucumbers a nightshade vegetable?</h2>Here's a list of vegetables that people often think are nightshades, but are not nightshades: Black pepper. Coffee. Cucumbers.<h2>What is a nightshade fruit?</h2>Fruit is an edible part of a plant that develops from a flower and contains seeds. Peppers and eggplant are also technically nightshade fruits. Vegetables are any other edible part of a plant, like the roots, stems, or leaves. Potatoes are a nightshade vegetable, not a fruit.<h2>Are strawberries a nightshade?</h2>Strawberries are not nightshades; in fact, they're part of the rose family! A strawberry is not actually a berry. By technical definition, a berry is a fleshy fruit produced from a single seed. The strawberry, however has its dry, yellow “seeds” on the outside (each of which is actually considered a separate fruit).<h2>What is a nightshade vegetable?</h2>Nightshade vegetables belong to the family of plants with the Latin name Solanaceae. Potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants are all common nightshades. Many are rich sources of nutrients and serve as staple foods for various cultures.<h2>Does Tom Brady eat bread subway?</h2>BOISE, Idaho — If you watch NFL football, you've probably seen Tom Brady in ads about Subway bread that he doesn't eat. But now the notoriously health-conscious quarterback can enjoy a Subway sandwich — if he's in the right place.<h2>Why are vegetables called nightshade?</h2>Nightshade plants contain different types of alkaloid compounds, food factors that cause physiological changes in the body. The origin of the name “nightshade” is not clear, but some suggest the name describes how these plants prefer to grow and flower in the night and shade.<h2>Does Tom Brady eat pasta?</h2>The Tom Brady diet restricts your intake of the following foods: Gluten-containing foods. This includes bread, pasta, breakfast cereals, pastries, and wheat-flour-based foods of any kind.<h2>Does Brady eat bread?</h2>Tom Brady is famously picky about his diet, but even he is taking a bite out of Subway's new bread.<h2>What does Gisele Bundchen eat in a day?</h2>She usually ingests a wholefood-laden salad for lunch, or a hearty soup with vegetables. Bündchen eats meat and fish, but not often, and eats plant based almost all the time.<h2>Are avocados a nightshade?</h2>In the end, if you feel you might have some sort of autoimmune disease or that you're suffering from a leaky gut, you should try cutting out the foods on the nightshade vegetables list. There are several great replacements for these foods, like avocado, Brussels sprouts, and Jerusalem artichokes.<h2>Are bananas anti-inflammatory?</h2>Bananas are not a typical choice for people with arthritis, but the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in them may aid in protecting the body against certain oxidative stress.<h2>Is coffee an inflammatory?</h2>Research suggests that drinking coffee — even in small amounts — may help reduce inflammation. In turn, this may lower your risk of certain conditions, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and perhaps even certain types of cancer. Nonetheless, coffee may increase inflammation in some people.<h2>Does Tom Brady eat chocolate?</h2>Tom Brady eats dark chocolate at the end of every gameday, according to his wellness site.
